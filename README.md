### Recommended way to run the exercise (SWAN)

The Tau exercise is organised in two Jupyter notebooks, both contained in this repository.

To run the notebooks with regular CERN resources:
* Open a SWAN session at swan.cern.ch (the defaults are good, as of writing this pick software stack 97a and make sure to use Python3)
* In the SWAN session, click on the item on the right-hand side that says "Download Project from git"
* Copy-paste https://github.com/steggema/cms-das-tau.git
* You're all set and can click on the two exercises, `tau_short_exercise_1.ipynb` and `tau_short_exercise_2.ipynb`
